## üêç Programming Concepts Demonstrated

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Several programs in this repository utilize Python classes and objects to demonstrate:
- **Encapsulation**: Data and methods bundled together
- **Methods**: Functions defined within classes
- **Constructors**: Object initialization
- **Instance variables**: Object-specific data storage

### Core Python Concepts
- **Control Structures**: if-else statements, loops
- **Functions**: Reusable code blocks
- **User Input**: Interactive program execution
- **Mathematical Operations**: Arithmetic and logical operations
- **String Formatting**: Clean output presentation

## üìñ Program Details

### Calculator.py
A comprehensive calculator implementing basic arithmetic operations using class-based structure for better code organization and reusability.

### Area.py
Calculates areas of different geometric shapes like rectangles, circles, triangles, etc. Demonstrates mathematical computations and possibly class inheritance for different shapes.

### EvenOdd.py
Simple program to check whether a given number is even or odd using modulus operator.

### LeapYear.py
Determines if a given year is a leap year based on the standard leap year rules.

### Max.py
Finds the maximum value among a set of numbers, showcasing comparison operations and data handling.

### SimpleIntrest.py
Calculates simple interest using the formula: SI = (P √ó R √ó T) / 100, where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time.

### Table.py
Generates and displays multiplication tables for given numbers, demonstrating loop structures and formatted output.
